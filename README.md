# Complexity in music perception - is it reflected in listeners' pupil dilation?

Hi! This repository serves as my personal archive for the course project of DM2350 - Human Perception for Information Technology @ [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), under the supervision of [Mr. Ekström](https://www.kth.se/profile/axeleks?l=en). It mainly contains the Python-based data cleaning, analysis, and visualization parts of this project. This project was collaboratively completed by Edris Hakimzada <edrish@kth.se>, Helena T. Linder Miñambres <htlm@kth.se>, Izabelle Lundqvist <izalun@kth.se>, and me <yuxuanzh@kth.se>.
